# Payment Status Management

## Overview

While invoice statuses track business logic, payment statuses track individual blockchain transactions. One invoice can have multiple payments (partial payments, overpayments), each with their own blockchain lifecycle.

## Payment vs Invoice Status

| Aspect        | Payment Status                    | Invoice Status                    |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Scope**     | Individual transaction            | Overall invoice state             |
| **Lifecycle** | Blockchain confirmation           | Business workflow                 |
| **Count**     | Multiple per invoice              | One per invoice                   |
| **Concerns**  | Technical (confirmations, reorgs) | Business (completion, expiration) |

## Payment Status Definitions

| Status       | Description                           | Confirmations | Duration               | Notes                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| `detected`   | Transaction found in mempool or block | 0             | 0-15 seconds           | Not yet confirmed     |
| `confirming` | Transaction included in block         | 1-11          | 15 seconds - 3 minutes | Gaining confirmations |
| `confirmed`  | Sufficient confirmations received     | 12+           | Permanent              | ‚úÖ Final success state |
| `failed`     | Transaction failed or reverted        | N/A           | Permanent              | ‚ùå Technical failure   |
| `orphaned`   | Block containing tx was orphaned      | N/A           | Temporary              | Reverts to `detected` |

## Payment State Transitions

```

### Valid Transitions

```
detected ‚Üí confirming    (included in block)
detected ‚Üí failed        (transaction failed)

confirming ‚Üí confirmed   (sufficient confirmations)
confirming ‚Üí orphaned    (block orphaned)
confirming ‚Üí failed      (transaction reverted)

orphaned ‚Üí detected      (transaction back in mempool)
orphaned ‚Üí failed        (transaction dropped)
```

### Forbidden Transitions

**‚ùå From terminal states**
- `confirmed` and `failed` are final
- `orphaned` is temporary and must transition

**‚ùå Skipping confirmation process**
- Cannot go directly `detected ‚Üí confirmed`
- Must gain confirmations incrementally

## Confirmation Requirements

### Tron Network (TRC-20 USDT)

| Confirmation Level | Blocks | Time  | Use Case                |
| ------------------ | ------ | ----- | ----------------------- |
| **Detected**       | 0      | 0s    | Show "payment detected" |
| **Safe**           | 1      | ~15s  | Small amounts (<$100)   |
| **Secure**         | 12     | ~3min | Standard amounts        |
| **Final**          | 19     | ~5min | Large amounts (>$10k)   |

```go
const (
    MinConfirmationsSmall  = 1   // <$100
    MinConfirmationsStandard = 12  // $100-$10k  
    MinConfirmationsLarge  = 19  // >$10k
)

func GetRequiredConfirmations(amount decimal.Decimal) int {
    if amount.LessThan(decimal.NewFromInt(100)) {
        return MinConfirmationsSmall
    }
    if amount.LessThan(decimal.NewFromInt(10000)) {
        return MinConfirmationsStandard
    }
    return MinConfirmationsLarge
}
```

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Payment-Specific Metrics

| Metric                  | Description                         | Alert Threshold |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Confirmation Time**   | Average time `detected ‚Üí confirmed` | >10 minutes     |
| **Failed Payment Rate** | `failed` / total payments           | >5%             |
| **Orphaned Block Rate** | `orphaned` payments frequency       | >1%             |
| **Stuck Payments**      | Payments in `confirming` >1 hour    | Any occurrence  |


## Payment Processing Flow

### 1. Transaction Detection
```
Blockchain Scanner ‚Üí Payment.detected ‚Üí Invoice.partial/confirming
```

### 2. Confirmation Tracking
```
Block Scanner ‚Üí Payment.confirmations++ ‚Üí Check thresholds
```

### 3. Final Confirmation
```
Payment.confirmed ‚Üí Invoice.paid ‚Üí Webhook notification
```

### 4. Failure Handling
```
Payment.failed ‚Üí Remove from invoice calculations ‚Üí Update invoice status
```

This dual-status system (invoice + payment) provides complete visibility into both business workflow and technical blockchain status, enabling precise payment tracking and reliable invoice completion detection.
